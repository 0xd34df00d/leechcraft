= Building =
Since you are reading this, you've already got the sources, but just in case, our git repo is at git://github.com/0xd34df00d/leechcraft.git

We will use so-called out-of-source builds. They allow to have different builds with different configuration simultaneously as well as easily remove the build directory if something goes wrong.
So, create a directory in near the `src` dir, say, `build`, and cd into it. Type

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=BuildType ../src 

Here BuildType specifies what type of the build you want:
* Release
  Release version with no debugging information and optimizations enabled.
* Debug
  Debug version with debugging information and no optimizations at all.
* RelWithDebInfo
  A version with both debugging information and optimizations enabled (recommended).
* MinSizeRel
  Release version with optimizations for producing executables of minimal size.

Then, after cmake successfully prepares the build system, type `ccmake .` and check the list of plugins to be built. You can enable or disable them there through a nice UI. Then, after you've selected what you want to build, run `make` and have a cup of coffee while LeechCraft compiles. If it fails, join the Jabber conference leechcraft@conference.jabber.ru and feel free to ask.

Become root and issue make install to install LeechCraft into /usr/local. That's it!

Please note that LeechCraft *won't work without installing*.

You may choose to install LeechCraft into different location by adding the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to the cmake command line.

= Dependencies =
Consider Depends:, Recommends:, Suggests: and Provides: to be virtual packages. Plugins don't depend on other plugins, they depend on functionality provided by other plugins.
