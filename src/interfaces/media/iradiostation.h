	/** @brief Describes a single radio station.
	 *
	 * Radio stations can be either single-stream or multistream.
	 * Single-stream stations have only one continuous stream of music
	 * like an Icecast/Shoutcast broadcasting. Multistream radio stations
	 * announce tracks one by one, like Last.FM radio. The difference is
	 * that it makes sense to skip a track in multistream radios, while
	 * there is nothing to skip in single-stream ones.
	 *
	 * Multistream radio stations will typically emit gotNewStream()
	 * signals from time to time and as a response to RequestNewStream(),
	 * while single-stream radio stations will emit gotPlaylist() once.
	 *
	 * This class has some signals (gotNewStream(), gotPlaylist() and
	 * gotError()), and one can use the GetQObject() method to get an
	 * object of this class as a QObject and connect to those signals.
	 *
	 * Ownership of this class is either passed to the caller or remains
	 * belonging to the returning plugin, this class never deletes itself.
