 * methods), relative path (which is passed to the
 * IScriptLoader::CreateScriptLoaderInstance() method as parameter) and

 * the corresponding extensions):
 * - qtscript for *.qs, *.js, *.es.
 * - python for *.py
 * - ruby for *.rb

 * than global ones, you should call AddLocalPrefix() after calling
 * AddGlobalPrefix().
