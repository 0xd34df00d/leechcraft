 *
 * This interface is a base for all plugins loadable by LeechCraft. If a
 * plugin doesn't provide this interface (qobject_cast<IInfo*> to it
 * fails), it would be considered as a malformed one and would be
 * unloaded.
 *
 * The initialization of plugins is split into two stages: Init() and
 * SecondInit().
 *
 * In the first one plugins ought to initialize their data structures,
 * allocate memory and perform other initializations that don't depend
 * depend on other plugins. After the first stage (after Init()) the
 * plugin should be in a usable state: no call shall fail because
 * required data hasn't been initialized.
 *
 * In the second stage, SecondInit(), plugins can fill the data that
 * depends on other plugins. For example, in SecondInit() the Tab++
 * plugin, which shows a fancy tab tree, queries the MainWindow about
 * existing tabs and about plugins that can open tabs and connects to
 * their respective signals.
 *
 * So, as the rule of thumb, if the action required to initialize your
 * plugin depends on others - move it to SecondInit(), leaving in Init()
 * only basic initialization/allocation stuff like allocation memory for
 * the objects.
