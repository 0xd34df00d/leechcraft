 * Plugins which provide downloading capabilities and want to be visible
 * by LeechCraft and other plugins as download providers should
 * implement this interface.
 *
 * Plugins implementing this interface are expected to have following
 * signals:
 * - jobFinished (int id)
 *   Indicates that a job with a given id has finished.
 * - jobFinished (int id)
 *   Indicates that a job with a given id has been removed.
 * - handleJobError (int id, IDownload::Error error)
 *   Indicates that an error occured while downloading a job with the
 *   given id.
 *
 * In order to obtain IDs for the tasks plugins are expected to use
 * ICoreProxy::GetID() in order to avoid name clashes.
