# Find the Qwt 6.x includes and library, either the version linked to Qt3 or the version linked to Qt4

#    - the Qwt DLL is where the other DLLs for Qt are (QT_DIR\bin) or in the path
#    - the Qwt .h files are in QT_DIR\include\Qwt or in the path
#    - the Qwt .lib is where the other LIBs for Qt are (QT_DIR\lib) or in the path
#
# Qwt6_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find qwt.h if Qwt
# Qwt6_Qt4_LIBRARY - The Qwt6 library linked against Qt4 (if it exists)
# Qwt6_Qt3_LIBRARY - The Qwt6 library linked against Qt4 (if it exists)
# Qwt6_Qt4_FOUND   - Qwt6 was found and uses Qt4
# Qwt6_Qt3_FOUND   - Qwt6 was found and uses Qt3
# Qwt6_FOUND - Set to TRUE if Qwt6 was found (linked either to Qt3 or Qt4)
