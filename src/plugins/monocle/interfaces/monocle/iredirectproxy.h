	 * plugin.

	 * The GetRedirectedMime() method returns the MIME of the converted
	 * document.

	 * GetRedirectSource() returns the filename of the source document,
	 * and GetRedirectTarget() returns the filename of the converted
	 * document.
	 *
	 * The redirect proxy should start converting after a small delay
	 * after construction, as it is a common pattern to request temporary
	 * IRedirectProxy objects to get the MIME type, for example.
