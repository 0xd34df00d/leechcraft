	 * This interface should be implemented by plugins that provide
	 * format backends for Monocle document reader â€” that is, for those
	 * plugins that can load documents or convert them.
	 *
	 * Some backends only convert a document from their format to another
	 * format, probably supported by another Monocle plugin. This is
	 * called a redirection, and the backend should return
	 * LoadCheckResult::Redirect from the CanLoadDocument() method in
	 * this case. The backend should also return a valid redirect proxy
	 * from the GetRedirection() method in this case.
