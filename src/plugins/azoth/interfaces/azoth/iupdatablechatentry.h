	/** @brief Interface for entries that can modify messages bodies.
	 *
	 * This interface is to be implemented by entries (implementing
	 * ICLEntry) that can modify the bodies of the messages after the
	 * messages were received and handled by Azoth.
	 *
	 * When the body of the message is to be changed, the performJS()
	 * should be emitted with the corresponding JavaScript code that
	 * changes the message in the opened chat tabs. IMessage::GetBody()
	 * should also return the new message body after this signal.
	 *
	 * For example, a social network protocol plugin may emit an
	 * ICLEntry::gotMessage() signal when the message is received, but
	 * request additional information from the social network about the
	 * attachments, emitting IUpdatableChatEntry::performJS() after that
	 * info is fetched.
