	 *
	 * If a room supports getting/changing permissions for participants,
	 * this interface should be implemented by the room's CL entry
	 * object.
	 *
	 * There may be different permission classes in a room, and each
	 * permission class has several permission variants, which are
	 * exclusive, while permissions from different classes are not
	 * exclusive.
	 *
	 * For example, an XMPP MUC room has two permission classes: roles
	 * and affiliations. Role class and affiliation class have a
	 * different set of permissions, like participant/moderator or
	 * outcast/member/admin respectively.
