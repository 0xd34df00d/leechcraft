		 * - SQLiteVacuum of type bool
		 *   Used if SQLite is chosen to set the VACUUM option.
		 * - SQLiteJournalMode of type string
		 *   Used if SQLite is chosen to set the desired journal mode.
		 * - SQLiteTempStore of type string
		 *   Used if SQLite is chosen to set the temporary storage.
		 * - SQLiteSynchronous of type string
		 *   Used if SQLite is chosen to set the sync mode.
		 * - PostgresHostname
		 *   Used if PostgreSQL is chosen to set server's host name.
		 * - PostgresPort
		 *   Used if PostgreSQL is chosen to set server's port.
		 * - PostgresDBName
		 *   Used if PostgreSQL is chosen to set database name.
		 * - PostgresUsername
		 *   Used if PostgreSQL is chosen to set user name for the
		 *   database.
		 * - PostgresPassword
		 *   Used if PostgreSQL is chosen to set password for the
		 *   database.
		 *
		 * These settings are also queried when constructing the
