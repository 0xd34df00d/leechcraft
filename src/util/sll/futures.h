	 * to a handler when it is ready.
	 *
	 * This function creates a <code>QFutureWatcher</code> of a type
	 * compatible with the QFuture type returned from the \em f, makes
	 * sure that \em rh handler is invoked when the future finishes,
	 * and then invokes the \em f with the given list of \em args (that
	 * may be empty).
	 *
	 * \em rh should accept a single argument of the same type \em T
	 * that is wrapped in a <code>QFuture</code> returned by the \em f
	 * (that is, \em f should return <code>QFuture<T></code>).
	 *
	 * @param[in] f A callable that should be executed, taking the
	 * arguments \em args and returning a <code>QFuture<T></code> for
	 * some \em T.
	 * @param[in] rh A callable that will be invoked when the future
	 * finishes, that should be callable with a single argument of type
	 * \em T.
	 * @param[in] parent The parent object for all QObject-derived
	 * classes created in this function, may be a <code>nullptr</code>.
	 * @param[in] args The arguments to be passed to the callable \em f.
