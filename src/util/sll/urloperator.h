	/** @brief Manipulates query part of an QUrl object.
	 *
	 * This class abstracts away differences between Qt4 and Qt5 QUrl and
	 * QUrlQuery handling, and it should be used in all new code instead
	 * of direct calls to Qt API.
	 *
	 * This class is used as follows:
	 * -# An object of this class is constructed on a (named) QUrl object.
	 * -# New URL query parameters are added by calling this object with a
	 *    pair of matching key and value.
	 * -# Existing URL query parameters are removed via the -= operator.
	 * -# The URL is updated on UrlOperator object destruction.
	 *
	 * Intended usage:
	 * \code{.cpp}
		QUrl someUrl { ... };
		UrlOperator { someUrl }
				("key1", "value1")
				("key2", "value2");
	   \endcode
	 *
	 * Here, an unnamed UrlOperator object is created that is valid only
	 * inside the corresponding expression, thus the changes to
	 * <code>someUrl</code> are visible immediately after executing that line.
	 *
	 * @note The changes are \em guaranteed to be applied on UrlOperator
	 * object destruction. Nevertheless, they may still be applied
	 * earlier on during calls to operator()() and operator-=().
