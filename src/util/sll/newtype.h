	/** @brief A somewhat "strong" typedef.
	 *
	 * \em NewType provides Haskell's newtype-like semantics.
	 *
	 * Typical usage is as follows:
	 *	\code
		using FirstAlias = Util::NewType<BaseType, NewTypeTag>;
		using SecondAlias = Util::NewType<BaseType, NewTypeTag>;
		\endcode
	 *
	 * After this, <code>FirstAlias</code> and <code>SecondAlias</code>
	 * become more or less independent from C++'s type system point of
	 * view.
	 *
	 * @note Using this class (and this header) requires pretty decent
	 * C++14 support for now provided only by clang 3.4+.
	 *
	 * @tparam T The type for which to create the params for.
