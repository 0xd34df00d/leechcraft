.SH NAME
\fBLeechCraft\fR \- Extensible modular internet-client.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B leechcraft@LC_LIBSUFFIX@ [options] [\fIentity\fR\fB]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B LeechCraft
is an extensible cross-platfrom modular internet-client. Modularity means it is
plugin-based: each task is done by a separate plugin. Currently plugins
include, but are not limited to, the following:
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
\fBAggregator\fR - RSS/Atom feed reader.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBAzoth\fR - multiprotocol IM client, currently supporting XMPP/IRC and lots of
other stuff.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBBitTorrent\fR - well, BitTorrent client.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBLackMan\fR - userspace package manager for easy installation of iconsets,
emoticons, themes, scripting plugins and other similar things.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBLMP\fR - feature-rich collection-oriented audio player.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBMonocle\fR - modular document viewer.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBPoshuku\fR - WebKit-based web browser.
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Common Qt Options
.TP
.B -style style, -style=style
Specify the Qt widget style to use (examples: plastique, cleanlooks).
.TP
.B -stylesheet stylesheet, -stylesheet=stylesheet
Specify the user stylesheet to use when rendering widgets.
.TP
.B -reverse
Sets the application's layout direction to right-to-left.
.SS Options Specific to LeechCraft
.TP
.B \fIentity\fR
The entity to handle by LeechCraft. This could be, for example, a torrent file
name or an URL.
.TP
.B -v [ --version ]
Print LeechCraft version and exit.
.TP
.B --automatic
Don't consider this entity to be added as a result of user's action. This way
LeechCraft would try to minimize the number of dialogs with user. Suitable for
adding entities from cron or some other sources, where the user could be AFK.
.IP
This only makes sense if an \fIentity\fR has been specified.
.TP
.B -H [ --handle ]
The item must be handled, not downloaded. Useful when setting LeechCraft as
default browser: this way it won't ask if the item should be opened in Poshuku
or downloaded.
.IP
This only makes sense if an \fIentity\fR has been specified.
.TP
.B -D [ --download ]
The item must be downloaded only, not handled. This is similar to the
\fB\-H\fR option, but does the reverse.
.IP
This only makes sense if an \fIentity\fR has been specified.
.TP
.B -T [ --type ] \fIarg\fR
Defines the type of the passed \fBentity\fR. It could be one of the
following:
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
\fIurl\fR for URLs that come from user input.
.IP \(bu 4
\fIurl_encoded\fR for percent-encoded URLs.
.IP \(bu 4
\fIfile\fR for local file paths.
.RE
.IP
By default, \fIurl\fR is assumed.
.IP
This only makes sense if an \fIentity\fR has been specified.
.TP
.B -P [ --plugin ] \fIpath\fR
Use this option only if you know what you are doing.
.IP
Loads only plugin from the given \fIpath\fR. Specifying this option effectively
disables loading plugins from standard places, so only given plugin would be
loaded. Moreover, the given plugin's dependencies aren't evaluated, so you
should load them by hand, specifying multiple \fB-P\fR options.
.IP
As already been said, multiple \fB-P\fR options could be specified, resulting
in multiple plugins being loaded.
.IP
If this option is specified, LeechCraft doesn't check if it is already running,
it just starts up and loads the given plugin(s). So, be careful with this
option: you could either end up with lots of LeechCraft instances running or
have your data corrupt if the specified plugin doesn't support sharing data
between multiple running instances.
.TP
.B --nolog
Disable custom logger that writes logs to
~/.leechcraft/{debug,warning,critical}.log and print everything to
stdout/stderr.
.TP
.B --bt
Print backtrace along with warning-level log entries. Helps tracing where do
the warning entries come from.
.TP
.B --clrsckt
Clear stalled local socket. Useful when LeechCraft doesn't start up and you know
that no other instances are running.
.TP
.B --no-app-catch
Disables catching all the exceptions in QApplication::notify(). Useful for
debugging purposes only and shouldn't be used for live setups.
.TP
.B --autorestart
Automatically restart if closed. This is done via Session Manager, so it won't
work everywhere.
.TP
.B --help
Print a short help message.
.SH FILES
LeechCraft stores user-specific stuff in two places: \fI~/.config/Deviant\fR
for settings and \fI~/.leechcraft\fR for more "heavy" data like RSS reader databases.
XDG spec is not followed for the latter for hysterical raisins. Caches are stored in
\fI$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Deviant/leechcraft\fR.
.PP
Plugins are loaded from \fI/usr/local/lib/leechcraft@LC_LIBSUFFIX@/plugins\fR and
\fI/usr/lib/leechcraft@LC_LIBSUFFIX@/plugins\fR.
.SH BUGS
There are many of them. Please report bugs to
\fIhttps://dev.leechcraft.org/projects/leechcraft/issues\fR or via the Dolozhu
plugin right from LeechCraft.
